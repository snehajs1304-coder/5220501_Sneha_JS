The Mini-Max Sum problem on HackerRank asks you to perform the following: 


Given: Five positive integers.

Task: Find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five given integers.

Output: Print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers. 

Example
Input: 1 2 3 4 5
Output: 10 14

Explanation of the Example
Given the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: 

To find the minimum sum, you sum all numbers except the largest (5): 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
To find the maximum sum, you sum all numbers except the smallest (1): 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.
